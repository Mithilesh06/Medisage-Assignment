Problem Statement

A quiet student is the one who took at least one exam and did not score the high or the low score.
Write an SQL query to report the students (student_id, student_name) being quiet in all exams. Do not return the student who has never taken any exam.

Explanation

Tables - exams and students
I have written 2 queries, first to find distinct students to give at least one exam and
second to find max and min score of the student and excluding such students that are having
high and low score in a exam

Solution

select c.student_id, s.student_name as student_name
from (select b.students_given_exam as student_id
from (select student_id as students_given_exam from Exams
group by 1)b inner join (select student_id, max(score) as high_score,
min(score) as low_score from Exams)a on b.students_given_exam <> a.student_id
group by student_id order by student_id)c left join students s
on c.student_id = s.student_id
order by student_id
