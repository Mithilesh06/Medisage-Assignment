Problem Statement

Write an SQL query to find the names of all the activities with neither the maximum nor the minimum number of participants.

Explanation

Tables - activities and friends
I have written 2 queries, first to find max participants in a activity and
second to find min participants in a activity and excluding such activities that have
max and min participants.

Solution

select a.activity
from (select f.activity,count(f.id) as "participants"
from friends f group by 1)a where (select max(participants)
from (select f.activity,count(f.id) as "participants"
from friends f group by 1)a) > participants and
(select min(participants) from (select f.activity,count(f.id) as "participants"
from friends f group by 1)a) < participants
